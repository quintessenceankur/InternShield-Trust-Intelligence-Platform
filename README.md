# InternShield-Trust-Intelligence-Platform
InternShield – A Trust Intelligence Layer for detecting internship scams, evaluating risk exposure and analyzing candidate readiness using cognitive gap detection.

InternShield is built to solve a very real and growing problem in the student ecosystem.
Every year, thousands of students apply to internships that look legitimate on the surface but turn out to be misleading, exploitative or completely fake. At the same time many students apply for roles they are not technically prepared for which leads to repeated rejection and loss of confidence.
This project focuses on solving both problems together.

What problem are we addressing?
Students face two major risks:
Fraud or scam internships that demand hidden fees or make false promises.
Skill mismatch, where perceived ability does not match actual readiness for the role.
InternShield evaluates both.

What does InternShield do?
Instead of acting like a simple internship listing board our InternShield works as a decision intelligence layer.
It analyzes:
The credibility of an internship opportunity.
The financial red flags in the description.
The digital footprint of the organization.
The student’s actual readiness compared to role requirements.
The gap between perceived skill and tested skill.
The idea is simple: help students apply smarter and safer.

Core Highlights
• Risk Evaluation Engine
A weighted trust scoring model that checks authenticity signals, payment red flags and behavioral patterns in the listing.
• Scam Pattern Detection
Keyword and structure-based detection of suspicious phrases such as guaranteed placements, registration fees and urgency manipulation.
• Readiness & Skill Gap Analysis
Students evaluate their own confidence level and then complete a short reality check. The system calculates the difference and highlights overconfidence or underpreparedness.
• Rejection Probability Indicator
Based on the skill gap, the platform estimates the likelihood of success or rejection before the student applies.

Technology Used
The prototype is built entirely using:
HTML
CSS
Vanilla JavaScript

All scoring logic is handled on the client side using structured weighted calculations.
State is simulated using local storage for demonstration purposes.

Why this project is different
Most platforms optimize for faster applications.
InternShield optimizes for better decisions.
Instead of pushing students to apply more, it encourages them to apply responsibly.
Instead of reacting after a scam happens, it flags risk before the student clicks “Apply.”
This dual focus on opportunity safety and candidate readiness is what makes InternShield different.

Built for InnovationXHackathon 2026
This project was developed as a prototype to demonstrate how a trust first approach can improve the internship ecosystem for students.
